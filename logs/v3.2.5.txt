## New

- changed the scss files structure and also include each styles along with its component to minimize the manager styles file size
- animation to the gestures
- a couple more gestures
- presets to the image editor, also all the filters/presets that don’t have values are switchable
- new filter “selected”
- use WebWorker + fetch for the images “slightly faster than browser default, also fetch calls are always cached and will avoid re-downloading the image preview every time the sidebar is toggled”
- more ways to upload

## Fix

- gls cards will now have temp image until original is loaded to make sure we only load what we need.
- animate the upload-panel toggling instead of jumping up&down
- big files and long lists should render smoothly now

## Update

- make sure the events listeners are removed on components destroy
- include the font from the screenshot so you get the same look
- some files has changed names & folder structure
- i now kinda have a better idea of how to fix the sluggish animation, so if you are facing such an issue plz open a ticket with “a how to reproduce” so i can fix it
