## New

- added a new config key “controller” https://github.com/ctf0/Laravel-Media-Manager/wiki/Have-More-Control-Uploads.
- we now cache the server response on client side “probably the only manager that does that”, so navigation will be much faster specially for slow connections.
- for zip streaming, instead of bailing out when a file cant be read, we’ll download all as normal and show warning for the bad ones.


## Edit

- remove the crazy modal z-index
- changed the local storage key name
- vendor folders is now renamed to `packages` to avoid issues with installation
- some optimization & cleanup

- update wiki
