# Fix

- show correct total size in delete modal
- add some sense to css classes
- move dropzone file input inside its own form so you don’t have a bazillion inputs at the end of the DOM on each toggle of the modal
- some cleanup to the media-controller

# New

- add support for WYSIWYG Editors
 https://github.com/ctf0/Laravel-Media-Manager/wiki/Use-The-Manager-With-Any-WYSIWYG-Editor
- sidebar no selection icon is now a btn to reset “bulk select & search”

# Zip

- you can now download folders as a zip as well
- the zipping is now done on server & downloaded as a stream, so no worries about memory issues nor you need to install any extra js packages
- sadly no more progress for zipping as the form submit is not being handled by js, so any ideas/PRs are welcome


# Update

- update readme
- update assets
- update wiki
