- download zip with folder hierarchy
- lock/unlock no longer force refresh the manager
- auto-scroll to item after sidebar toggle
- dont cleanup cache unnecessarily 
- “alt/meta + click” (add current selected item + next selection to bulk select)


## Fix

- sluggish selection
- hiding sidebar on small screen without reseting files container position
- navigation selection delay
- not disabling refresh btn in some cases
- removing items from manager list because names are similar
- creating single char folder name


## Removed

- `mobile_alt_navigation` config, now alt nav on mobile is default
