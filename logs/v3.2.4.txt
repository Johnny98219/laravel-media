## Fix
- the ratio bar tool-tip not displaying correct count

### Image Editor

- empty visible image in editor when the sidebar is hidden
- now you can save the image automatically after zooming in/out “without the need to create a cropping box”
- updating the drag mode on dblclick
- now the filters will work correctly as in the camanjs example, also both “greyscale & invert” filters are now switchable


## New
- add swipe gesture to the sidebar
- add pinchIn gesture to refresh 
- persist the sidebar status according to user actions.
- add an helper event for hammerjs events bubbling check “https://github.com/ctf0/Laravel-Media-Manager/wiki/Customization-&--Optimization#customization”


## Update

- move all bulma styles to the component scope to avoid interfering with the main page css
- reverse the gestures when using `__stack-files-reverse`
- use `IntersectionObserver` inside the global search too
- more cleanups
- update rdme & wiki
