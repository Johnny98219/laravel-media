## Fix

- db-click to open folder not selecting first item as it should
- `scrollByRow()` error after the manager modal is closed
- `__stack-files-reverse` not setting `left: 0`
- config `sanitized_text` function is now a string so we can use it with `call_user_func()`, this is to make sure uploaded files dont get a duplicated names when the random option is on.
- not reseting the filter btn class when no files are found


# New

- npm dep “plyr” to overcome the browser inconsistent player look
- tooltip to global search btn
- content ratio bar + an option to enable/disable it under config `show_ratio_bar`


# Update

- re-enable the refresh btn when the ajax call fail so you dont have to manually clear the manager cache.
- changed all the `media-manager__stack-` class names to `__stack-` except the main one.
- changed config `cacheExpiresAfter` to `cache_expires_after`
- all resources + config “plz republish”
