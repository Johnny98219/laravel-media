## Fix

- making too many requests to collect item metadata https://github.com/ctf0/Laravel-Media-Manager/issues/28
- wrong selected files size count
- sidebar item title wrong key
- dbl click while bulk selection is on
- reset for effects only
- more optimization to the backend
- better scroll to item on load

## New

- option to enable lazy load image on click/interaction (when set to ‘true’ auto selecting first item will be disabled)
- option to support more image mime-types
- holding refresh btn will now clear both local storage & cache

## Update

- remove file list animation “blame vue”
- upgrade laravel version
- remove vue-multi-ref dep
- readme
- wiki
- resources
