## Fixed

- refetching content after cache clearing
- bad html in card modal causing tippy error
- bulk selection with "shift+click" doesn't work correctly when **sortBy** is used
- a couple of gestures “recheck shortcuts”
- better scroll to item in long list on manager init “hopefully its fixed for good now”
- folders with locked items getting fake remove

## New

- move modal have the selected items info as well “same as the delete modal”
- removed “vue-scroll-stop” and replaced it with something simpler
- the url will be changed according to the opened folder
  - so you can use the back/forward button like normal.
  - open a path directly with a url
  - using local storage to remember opened folders now works only for the modal
- locked list moved to ls instead of saving it with each cached key
