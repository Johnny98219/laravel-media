## Fixed

- showing total size as false

## New

- add description to the toolbar btn icons “refresh, lock, visibility”
- add support for cache storage for lazy image loading “with fallback to normal when needed”
- simplified the cache removal method
- switch visibility icon according to file status
- long press refresh btn will also clears the “cached images” storage 
- folders with locked items cant be “renamed, moved, copied or deleted”
- folders with locked items check is now incredibly faster because its pre-checked on the front side instead of the server
- lock/visibility
    + btns now follow the toolbar “main” btn instead of operating separately
    + now works with lists, instead of making a request per each
    + now icons reflect the item status instead of being a switch
- some cleanups & better APIs
- visibility btn in preview card
- npm dependency “vue-async-computed”
